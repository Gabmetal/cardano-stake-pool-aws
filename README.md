# Cardano Stake Pool Ops

This project aims to simplify the setup of a Cardano Stake Pool (core & relay nodes) by implementing a dead simple setup to get up and running quickly and, most importantly, securely inside the AWS cloud.

## 🐋 Features

- Most simple way to setup a secure "Cardano Stake Pool"
- Well configured AWS cloud
- Management tools & beautiful graphs

Our managed pools offer a "High Pledge" and great rewards. Feel free to join! We would love to get to know you.

## Prerequisite

This guide assumes that you have `aws-cli` setup locally. It's an incredibly simple process and well explained within the official documentation that can be found [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html).

Once you have the `aws` binary installed on your machine, run the following command to get authenticated:

```bash
# follow the prompts
aws configure
```

## 🐙 Usage

```bash
# useful scripts
```

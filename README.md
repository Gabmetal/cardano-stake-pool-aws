# Cardano Stake Pool Ops

This project aims to be the most simple way to set up a Cardano Stake Pool (core & relay nodes) inside a secure, highly-available, and fault-tolerant AWS cloud network. It implements an easily configurable, yet a well-opinionated approach, based on some of the best practices found inside the community.

## üêã Features

- Secure by default
- Most simple AWS setup with 1 Core and 2 Relay nodes
- Highly-available & fault-tolerant cloud
- Automatic notifications for CPU, RAM and storage alerts when certain thresholds are met
- Several useful management tools & beautiful graphs

Thanks to Guild Operators who have created some great tooling for stake pool operators!

_Our managed pools offer a "High Pledge" and great rewards. Feel free to join! We would love to get to know you._

## Prerequisite

This guide assumes that you have `aws-cli` setup locally. It's an incredibly simple process and well-explained within the official documentation that can be found [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html).

Once you have the [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html) installed on your machine, run the following command to get authenticated:

```bash
aws configure

# next, let's install the serverless CLI tool and also authenticate into it
npm install -g serverless
serverless
```

Serverless is an amazing tool that _automates the setup of our AWS account._ It is important to note that while you configure your AWS account, you need to select a region that, at least, offers 3 Availability Zones, like `us-east-1`. View the regions you may select [here](./AWS_AZ_ZONES.md).

## Get Started

```bash
# 1. let's create a .env file and make sure to set all variables as appropriate
cp .env.example .env

# 2. now, we need to create a SSH key pair that can authenticate our device securely with AWS
./scripts/generate_ssh_key_pair.sh

# 3. next, let's create your Stake Pool environment including 1x Block Producer node & 2x Relay nodes
npm run build:stake-pool
## please note: the creation process may take ~3 hours for testnet nodes & ~8 hours for mainnet nodes
## during this process, you will receive 2 emails asking to confirm a "subscription" which is required in order for you to receive "system alerts"

# 4. you can now securely SSH into your Cardano node (navigate to AWS EC2 to figure out the host and use the port defined in .env)
ssh -i "cardano-stake-pool.pem" ubuntu@ec2-12-68-116-220.compute-1.amazonaws.com -p 22
```

## üêô Useful snippets

```bash
# if you want to delete the AWS resources. Please beware, this will delete your stake pool
npm run cleanup # cleans all environments
npm run cleanup:guild
npm run cleanup:testnet
npm run cleanup:mainnet

## Starting the "Block Producer Node" or one of the "Relay Nodes"
start

## Restarting the node service
restart

## Stopping the node service
stop

## Viewing the status of your node & filtering logs
status
logs
logsToday
logsYesterday
journalctl --unit=cardano-node --since='2021-09-01 00:00:00' --until='2021-09-30 12:00:00'
```

## Important notes

- On mainnet, you will need to regenerate the KES key every 90 days (use our provided script - will be automated in future release)
- Cold keys must be generated and stored on your air-gapped offline machine
- Exercise plenty in testnet before launching a mainnet node

You may also want to check out the `.bash_aliases` file for some helpful shortcuts.

## üìà Changelog

## üí™üèº Contributing

Please see [CONTRIBUTING](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) for details.

One important command oftentimes used when debugging is:

```bash
tail -f /var/log/cloud-init-output.log
```

This command will log the "user data" script that builds the AWS Ubuntu server.
